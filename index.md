## Introduction

This project looks at how loops behave in certain spaces by creating visual representations.
In particular, we focus on a space called the Seifert fiberings of $S^2 \times S^1$, which is related to the loop space of the rotation group $SO(3)$.
Although algebraic concepts like homology can describe these spaces, they are often hard to understand just by reading formulas or definitions.

To make these ideas more accessible, we use visualizations to show how the basic shapes, or generators, of these spaces look.
Instead of using only abstract calculations, we show how these curves appear when placed inside the familiar space $S^2 \times S^1$.
Our goal is to give people a more intuitive and concrete way to explore and understand the structure of these loops.
